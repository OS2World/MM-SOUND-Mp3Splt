MM-SOUND-Mp3Splt
================

mp3splt is a free command-line utility that allows you to split mp3 and ogg files from a begin time to an end time, without need of decoding and reencoding. It's useful to split large mp3/ogg to make smaller files or to split entire albums to obtain original tracks.
