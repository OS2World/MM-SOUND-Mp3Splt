		 INSTALLING INFORMATIONS FOR WINDOWS VERSION
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The easiest way to get your mp3splt installed is to copy just the file mp3splt.exe
(included in package) in Windows main directory (usually C:\WINDOWS).

Or, for more experienced users: you can extract mp3splt.exe in another directory
and then add that directory to PATH environment variable.

  IMPORTANT NOTE: MP3SPLT IS A TEXTUAL UTILITY. TO RUN USE MS-DOS PROMPT!

  For people who don't know how to use ms-dos prompt:
  - First copy mp3splt.exe as described before.
  - Run MS-DOS prompt in Start Menu -> Accessories or just Choose
    Start -> Run... then type
    command
    (or cmd32, depends on which Windows you are using)
  - You will have a black window writing C:\WINDOWS> or something similar.
  - Now you have just to move to directory where mp3 are using 'cd' command, type:
	cd X:\directory1\directory2\mp3\mymp3\
    followed by ENTER key and where X is the the drive (for example C or D)
  - Ok, now just type
    mp3splt
    you will se an help message on how to use mp3splt.

  NOTES:
    1) When file or directory contains a space, you should use quotation marks "".
    for example: mp3splt "My Album.mp3"..... or cd "My Mp3"
    Or temporarily rename file to something shorter ;)
    2) On latest version of Windows (XP) you can use auto-complete function,
    by typing part of the filename and pressing the TAB key, name will be
    automatically completed.

  From this point you will be able to use mp3splt correctly.
  Please read man.html for a complete documentation and example of use.

  --> The .BAT Trick (used by Batman ;)
  -->
  --> PART 1
  --> If you don't want to run the MS-DOS prompt, you can use .bat files:
  --> 1) Create a new Text file (.txt file) in dir where the mp3 is.
  --> 2) Open with notepad or another text editing tool.
  --> 3) Write the line corresponding to what you want to run inside this file.
  -->	 For example:
  -->	 mp3splt -c file.cddb "My album.mp3" -o @n-@t -d new
  --> 4) Save the file and change extension from .txt to .bat
  --> 5) Double click on the .bat file and all is done
  --> In this way you don't have to use 'cd' to change current directory
  -->
  --> PART 2
  --> If you often run mp3splt with the same command line. For example
  --> mp3splt -w album.mp3 -d New
  --> There is a trick that can save lot of time:
  --> 1) Create a new Text file (.txt file) in dir you usually have mp3s.
  --> 2) Open with notepad or another text editing tool.
  --> 3) Write the line inside the file as you were writing it to run mp3splt
  -->	 but replace the filename with "%1". Example: mp3splt -w %1 -d New
  --> 4) Now save the file and rename it to a file with .bat extension.
  -->	 Example: if you saved the file dewrap.txt -> dewrap.bat
  --> 5) Drag and drop the file to be splitted on the .bat file you just
  -->	 created and the play is done.
  --> Now for each file you wish to dewrap, you can just drag and drop the mp3 file
  --> on the bat. Of course this trick can be applied to any use of mp3splt.
  --> Be careful on where file have been created, maybe they are in root dir (C:\)

  I know, you are thinking all this is too difficult. This is not true, listen me;
  I can assure that once you get experienced using this program you will be really
  fast. Is faster to open a window program, selecting all files to open, select
  output file and then start, or instead to write only: mp3splt -w file.mp3 ?? ;)
  However don't worry, I will try to write a Graphic Interface as soon as possible.

COMPILING INFORMATIONS

In package you will already find a binary of mp3splt (mp3splt.exe),
that has been compiled with MingW v. 2.0.0 (http://mingw.sf.net).

From mp3splt 1.4 you need also these libraries:

libogg	    - http://www.xiph.org
libvorbis   - http://www.xiph.org
libmad	    - http://www.mars.org/home/rob/proj/mpeg/

To compile using MingW or any gcc compatible application type:

 gcc -o mp3splt.exe -Wall -O2 *.c -lvorbisfile -lvorbis -logg -lm -lwsock32 -lmad

However, you can compile it using M$ Visual C or any other compiler, but I don't
know if all functions are supported.

Good luck!
